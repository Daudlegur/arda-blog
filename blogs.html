        <h1>What makes the Lord of the Rings timeless?</h1>
        <h4>BY ARTHUR R. on FEBRUARY 30, 2019</h4>
        <p>Tolkien’s stories of dragons, hobbits and adventure have been around since 1937. That’s eighty years ago—for those of you who don’t want to do the maths yourself. And yet, even spanning those eighty years, The Hobbit (soon followed by Lord of the Rings) is still around and well-known today. It’s not one of those ‘old books’ that you have to read for school. It’s not one of those ‘old books’ that no one really knows or cares about. People even made a movie of The Hobbit a whole seventy-five years after the book was released.</br>I don’t see that happening with many other books that old. (But then again, maybe I’m just not very knowledgeable on the topic of old books?)</br>What makes Tolkien’s writing so timeless? What is it that makes it stand out from the jumble of ‘old books’?</p>
        <span id="points10"></span><span id="moreText10"><p>I haven’t put nearly enough thought into this topic to do it justice, but the amount of thought that I have put into it has given me this tiny list of three things. </br>Anyone who has read (or even watched) The Hobbit or Lord of the Rings will know that Middle Earth is no ordinary fantasy realm. The amount of depth in this land is absolutely stunning. There are epic maps, there’s the history, the completely original races, the languages, the locations, the plants and animals and trees (and Ents). One only has to see a tiny glimpse to be absolutely awestruck. Tolkien didn’t just whip this up. He spent time. So much time. And it was absolutely worth it because now his world is right there for us to live in, even if it’s just for a short time.</br>I’m also indebted to Tolkien because he was the first to spell plural ‘elf’ and ‘dwarf’ as elves/dwarves instead of elfs/dwarfs. I cringe every time I see them spelled the non-Tolkien way, honestly. Thank you, Tolkien, for sparing me from this horror</br>Here I go about theme again. *cue all my readers rolling their eyes* “Can’t you talk about anything else, Jane??” Well, yes, but…but theme, guys. It’s the reason why books are powerful. It’s the way you can affect people’s lives. It’s the thing that sticks with your readers and keeps the story alive even eighty years after it was first published and forty-four years after the author died.</br>There are many themes in The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings. Choice, friendship, loss and sacrifice, power, humility, the small vs the mighty. They’re woven into the story and resound through the tale—like shinning mirrors we can look in and see a reflection of truth.</p>

        <h1>Analysis of Tolkien’s The Hobbit</h1>
        <h4>BY ARTHUR R. on FEBRUARY 18, 2019</h4>
        <p>The origin of The Hobbit (1937) is well known. One day in the late 1920s, Tolkien was grading essays when he came across a blank page and absently wrote the sentence “In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.” In a letter to W. H. Auden more than 25 years later, he wrote, “I did nothing about it, for a long time, and for some years I got no further than the production of Thror’s Map” (Letters 215). In the early 1930s, the story of the hobbit became one that he shared with his three sons during what he called their “winter reads.” By 1932, Tolkien had completed a manuscript that he shared with his Oxford friends, but most of those scholars saw the book as merely a children’s story. In 1936, Tolkien’s student Elaine Griffiths showed the manuscript to Susan Dagnall of George Allen & Unwin, who brought it to the attention of Stanley Unwin. Unwin asked his 10-year-old son, Rayner Unwin, to read it, and after Rayner gave it a positive review, Stanley published the book in 1937, with a cover designed by Tolkien himself and decorated with Old English runes. A first edition of 1,500 sold out quickly, and the book was published in the United States by Houghton Mifflin early in 1938. When Unwin asked for a sequel to The Hobbit but showed no interest in The Silmarillion, Tolkien began work on The Lord of the Rings. In order to make The Hobbit fit more coherently as a “prequel” to the trilogy, Tolkien revised the chapter on Gollum (“Riddles in the Dark”), changing the part played by the ring, so that in the revised version, Gollum blames Bilbo for what he sees as the theft of his ring and curses Bilbo forever. It was this revised chapter that was published in the second edition of The Hobbit in 1951.
        <span id="points1"></span><span id="moreText1">Tolkien later worked on another revision of The Hobbit, in which he tried to alter the narrative voice, the avuncular tone of which he, and a number of readers, had come to see as occasionally condescending and intrusive. Certain passages are clearly imagined as narrated by an older figure addressing children; for example, in the chapter “Barrels Out of Bond,” in which Bilbo comes up with the plan of how to save the dwarves, the narrator makes these comments: It was just at this moment that Bilbo suddenly discovered the weak point in his plan. Most likely you saw it some time ago and have been laughing at him; but I don’t suppose you would have done half so well yourselves in his place. (Hobbit 177) This is undoubtedly the kind of passage Tolkien had in mind when he wrote to Auden that the novel “was unhappily really meant, as far as I was conscious, as a ‘children’s story’, and as I had not learned sense then, and my children were not quite old enough to correct me, it has some of the sillinesses of manner caught unthinkingly from the kind of stuff I had had served to me” (Letters 215). However, when Tolkien sought to revise the book, he was discouraged from doing so by readers who thought that it would simply not be The Hobbit without that narrator.
        </br>The second edition, with the revised Gollum chapter, appeared in 1951, and subsequent editions followed in 1966 (to compete with a pirated edition that had been released in the United States by Ace Books), 1978, and 1995. At this point, The Hobbit has sold more than 100 million copies and has been translated into more than 40 different languages, making it not only one of Tolkien’s most popular works, but one of the most popular children’s books of all time. Citations of the text in the following commentary are to the second edition of the text as revised in 1966. An annotated version of the text edited by Douglas Anderson appeared in 1988 and was revised and reprinted in 2002. A two-part film version of the book produced by Peter Jackson (director of The Lord of the Rings) is projected to appear by 2012, an event that will probably spark a new edition and renewed interest in the book.The Hobbit may be considered in a number of different ways. It is, as Tolkien intended, a fairy story for children, and Bilbo, as a small person leaving home for the larger world, is in some ways a typical fairy-tale hero. (Bilbo is, however, 50 years old, which is certainly atypical for such a hero.) His career conforms to the conventional structures of folktales and mythic arche types of the hero as outlined by scholars such as Vladimir Propp and Joseph Campbell, and particularly to the patterns of narrative romance as outlined by Northrop Frye in his Anatomy of Criticism. The conventional patterns in the novel should not be surprising, since Tolkien was drawing on traditional Old Norse and Old English literature (including, in particular, stories of the dragon slayers Sigurd and Beowulf), as well as medieval chivalric romance as the sources for his narrative. The basic form of the medieval romance involves an initiation (Bilbo’s adventure with the trolls), a quest (Bilbo’s journey to the Lonely Mountain to find the dragon’s treasure), a descent into an underworld (Gollum’s cave, the elven king’s castle, and the dragon’s lair), and a return. More specifically, Bilbo’s adventure recalls romances concerned with the quest for the Grail. Such romances involve a wasteland; the restoration of a king; and a protagonist who, like Bilbo, asks questions. The novel also can be seen as a bildungsroman, a “novel of education” or “formation novel” that traces the development of a young person from childhood or adolescence into maturity in a kind of quest for identity, in the manner of Dickens’s Great Expectations, Joyce’s A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, or Goethe’s Wilhelm Meister’s Apprenticeship. Of course, Bilbo is only young in experience, but he, too, must mature; in fact, many medieval romances, including Chrétien de Troyes’s Perceval, the original Grail romance, are stories of a maturing hero on a quest for identity.

        <h1>The Hobbit You Grew Up With Isn’t Quite the Same As the Original, Published 75 Years Ago Today</h1>
        <h4>BY ARTHUR R. on FEBRUARY 15, 2019</h4>
        <p>The Lord of the Rings Trilogy had its time in the spotlight, with three epic movies, several computer and board games and a handful of albums. By comparison, its predecessor, The Hobbit, has hidden largely in the shadows. Today marks the 75 anniversary of that humble, hobbity beginning.</br>Published on September 21st, 1937, The Hobbit was born into critical acclaim. It was nominated for a Carnegie Medal, and won a prize for best juvenile fiction from the New York Herald Tribune. Here’s the dustcover for that first edition, apparently based on a design by Tolkein himself.</br>In fact, Tolkien was reported to be extremely involved in the design and illustration of the books, so much so that his editors joked about it. One of his publishers, Rayner Unwin, said: “In 1937 alone Tolkien wrote 26 letters to George Allen & Unwin… detailed, fluent, often pungent, but infinitely polite and exasperatingly precise… I doubt any author today, however famous, would get such scrupulous attention.”
        <span id="points2"></span><span id="moreText2"></br>But Tolkein had a very specific idea for how the story should look and went so far as to include a set of illustrations he had drawn. Those illustrations have never been published before, but The Guardian has a sneak peek at them.</br>Because The Hobbit was so successful, his publishers asked Tolkein for more. Tolkein, apparently, wrote a draft for a book called The Silmarillion. The Silmarillion moves away from hobbits and travels to the universe of Era—a universe that contains Middle-earth but also other lands like Valinor, Beleriand and Numenor. The publishers rejected The Silmarillion, figuring the people wanted more about hobbits, not a story about some land distant to them. So Tolkein began writing what he called “The New Hobbit” which would eventually turn into the beloved Lord of the Rings trilogy.</br>Fans might be surprised to find that the version of The Hobbit that they know and love doesn’t exactly match the text of the book’s first edition. Remember the riddle game that Bilbo and Gollum play deep in the goblin caves? You probably remember how it ended—Bilbo beats Gollum by stumping him, and when Gollum realizes what he’s lost, he panics and chases Bilbo through the caves. His final words in The Hobbit are “Thief! Thief, Baggins! We hates it, we hates it, we hates it forever!” Well in the very first edition of the book, that’s not what happens at all. In fact, Bilbo and Gollum part peacefully. Gollum admits that he’s been beat, and lets Bilbo go on his way. Tolkein had to change that chapter to fit with the later trilogies, in which Gollum returns and seeks the ring.</br>Tolkien also tried to change the entire tone of The Hobbit to fit the more serious trilogy. But he gave up after the third chapter, saying it “just wasn’t The Hobbit” any longer without its playful tone and quick pace.

        <h1>Thoughts on Lord of the Rings</h1>
        <h4>BY ARTHUR R. on FEBRUARY 14, 2019</h4>
        <p>Last week I finished listening to the last Lord of the Rings book. I listened to the first two spread out over the past year, and it wasn’t until near the end of the third book that the main idea was driven home. They’re long books (~20 hour listen each on normal speed), but I would say they are worthwhile.</br>If you want to read these books, what I say here might spoil them a little bit (in what I say under “underlying ideas”). That being said, it’s sort of obvious what type of ending there is going to be, so take that for what it’s worth.</br>The story itself was great. Tolkien is a creative genius. So many interesting & unique characters and events occur in the series, and it blows my mind how he was able to invent it all and piece it together in this story.</br>It was one of those books that you enjoy, are captivated by, and want to continue reading to see what happens next. There were moments when it was a little slow, but overall I’d say it was easy to get through once you get over the bit of confusion at the beginning of the series.
        <span id="points3"></span><span id="moreText3"></br>I find reading books like this to spark some creative juices in me. It’s an idea that’s talked about a lot in The Originals by Adam Grant, but not something I’m going to dive too deeply into.</br>After reading Lord of the Rings, it struck me how many similar aspects there are in Harry Potter. A few of the same character names, “The Dark Lord” and other aspects. Here’s an article about comparisons in more depth. I wonder how much of the plot Rowling took and moved around from Lord of the Rings. I hear Game of Thrones has some similarities as well.</br>What’s so crazy to me about Lord of the Rings is that you take this guy, Frodo, and his friends Sam, Pippin and Mary, and for all intensive purposes, they are relatively low in the hierarchy. They are small, weak, uninformed about the world, seemingly pretty unathletic. Yet, Frodo is given this mission to go on to save their world and he does it. At many times it’s incredibly hard, but it was his obligation to do so. He had this obligation and he followed through. Sam, Mary and Pippin each played a huge role in that as well, and it was by no means easy what they went through. Part of it was unfair, but at the end, they all ended up best off for it. Great experience, huge impact, amazing stories.</br>It makes me think if Frodo and Sam can deal with the craziness of their adventure in these books and do everything they need to do, then I should also be doing what I am here to do.</br>This goes into more of personal beliefs, but just real quick, I think we’re all here for a reason. That there’s a specific thing (or maybe a few) that will make us most fulfilled. For some that’s being an amazing parent, for rare others it’s starting Apple. I also believe many people never realize their potential for a variety of reasons. For me, I feel an obligation to do what I was put here to do. I have no idea what that thing is, but if I listen to my heart I think I’ll find it eventually. The Alchemist is a book all about that, and it was an awesome and quick read. Highly recommend. Maybe I’ll write more about that idea in the future.</br>Still, though, the Lord of the Rings makes me think about giving life our best shot and I resonate with that in a big way.</p>

        <h1>Why you should read J.R.R. Tolkien's The Silmarillion</h1>
        <h4>BY ARTHUR R. on FEBRUARY 13, 2019</h4>
        <p>In 1977, four years after author J.R.R. Tolkien’s death, his son Christopher completed and published his father’s most ambitious and sprawling book: The Silmarillion. Part Lord of the Rings backstory, part winding heroic epic, and part trippy meditation on the creation of the universe, The Silmarillion is a deeply weird and notoriously difficult-to-read saga. The prose is regal, the scale is enormous, and the plot (if you can even say that there’s a central plot) includes true love, backstabbing, accidental incest, gods, demons, the fate of the entire world, and three shining jewels known as the Silmarils. </br>It’s odd. It’s dense. It has dozens of characters with virtually identical names.</br>It’s also a profoundly beautiful and rewarding read.</br>Friday marked the 40th anniversary of the book’s publication, and to celebrate, two of EW’s biggest Tolkien nerds, Christian Holub and Devan Coggan, teamed up to reflect on (and geek out about) the wonderful weirdness of The Silmarillion.
        <span id="points4"></span><span id="moreText4">One important thing to know about this book is how different it is from both of its famous siblings, The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. Unlike those, The Silmarillion is not an adventure story Tolkien wrote as a bedtime story for his kids or an epic fantasy he could read aloud to his university students. It’s meant to be a comprehensive atlas of this big mythology that was bubbling in Tolkien’s brain for his entire life, and it’s also unfortunately incomplete — it took Tolkien’s son Christopher decades after his father’s death to piece the manuscripts together in a comprehensible order (a lifelong process Christopher showcases in detail in his recent book-length treatment of Beren and Lúthien, if anyone out there is interested).</br>But for all that, the imaginative scope of The Silmarillion is something to behold. Tolkien loved to build worlds, and early on he discusses his cosmic pantheon in depth. The Valar’s basic structure should be familiar to any student of mythology: Manwe the sky god is the leader, his wife Varda is queen of the stars, Ulmo controls the sea, Yavanna grows green, Aule builds things, Mandos is lord of the dead, Melkor is the fallen angel who turned against his kin, etc. But they each have rather unique personalities, and there are also some figures among them that indicate Tolkien’s deepest beliefs. My favorite Valar, for instance, is Nienna — basically the goddess of grief. As Tolkien writes, “she is acquainted in grief, and mourns for every wound that Arda (Earth) has suffered in the marring of Melkor.” But for Tolkien, coming to terms with the sadness of life is actually empowering: “all those who wait in Mandos cry to her, for she brings strength to the spirit and turns sorrow to wisdom.” Man, I love that.

        <h1>Why is introducing your kids to Tolkien such a dad thing?</h1>
        <h4>BY ARTHUR R. on FEBRUARY 12, 2019</h4>
        <p>Shoutout to Tolkien Dads everywhere, exposing their kids to orcs and dragons and heavy questions about power/corruption at way too young an age.</br>For me, the Valar are one of the aspects that give The Silmarillion its epic scope. They’re a bit like the Greek gods, sitting high atop Mt. Olympus, but the Valar are better behaved and less likely to get in trouble by having sex with people/animals they’re not supposed to. Personally, I’ve always been a fan of Varda, the Lady of the Stars, who is mentioned by name in The Lord of the Rings. The Elves adore her and refer to her as Elbereth and Gilthoniel, and it’s her name that Frodo invokes to help drive away the Ringwraiths at Weathertop. If Melkor is filled with darkness and hatred, Varda is his pure opposite: all radiance and light, the being who created the stars and brought light to world. In fact, one of my favorite lines in The Silmarillion describes how long before the world was born, Varda recognized the darkness in Melkor’s heart and “rejected him, and he hated her, and feared her more than all others whom Eru made.” </p>
        <span id="points5"></span><span id="moreText5"><p>Tolkien isn’t clear on whether that rejection was more of a general denouncing or a true romantic rejection, but either way, I’m very here for the badass star lady made of pure light who literally rejected Satan (who is now totally terrified of her).</br>But if we’re talking actual favorite personalities in The Silmarillion, things don’t really get good until the Elves show up. In The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, the Elves are generally portrayed as wise and regal, if occasionally a little snooty. In The Silmarillion, the Elves are a mess. They are the first beings brought into the world, and they are a bit like children — literally, they’re referred to as the Children of Ilúvatar — who the Valar have to teach how to walk.</br>Most of The Silmarillion concerns the fate of the three Silmarils, three perfect jewels that shine with pure, radiant light. The three Silmarils were crafted by a particularly proud and noble elf named Fëanor, and they immediately became the great treasure of the Elves. That is until Melkor stole them, killed Fëanor’s dad, and ran away to Middle-earth. (He was soon renamed Morgoth because he was so evil he needed an equally evil name.) Fëanor is understandably pissed, but instead of listening to the Valar and being rational, he and his seven sons swear an unbreakable oath to retrieve the Silmarils at any cost. If anyone, friend or foe, comes between them and a Silmaril, they will show no mercy. Fëanor’s oath essentially drives the rest of the book, pitting Elf against Elf (and Man and Morgoth and pretty much anyone else who gets in the way).</br>The story of the Silmarils features heavily in my personal favorite part of The Silmarillion (and one of Tolkien’s most popular stories): the tale of Beren and Lúthien, which you mentioned. Beren was a mortal man and an outlaw, Lúthien was an elf-maiden, and together, they fell deeply and irreversibly in love. Sound familiar? That’s because everyone in The Lord of the Rings won’t stop talking about how Aragorn and Arwen are basically Beren and Lúthien 2.0, as Lúthien is the only elf to give up her immortality and choose to live a mortal life with the person she loves. It’s romantic as hell. It’s also inspired by Tolkien’s real-life relationship with his beloved wife Edith, and their tombstones are each engraved with the names Beren and Lúthien. Again, romantic as hell.</p>

        <h1>Beren and Lúthien sequence is the most compelling in the book.</h1>
        <h4>BY ARTHUR R. on FEBRUARY 10, 2019</h4>
        <p>I love it so much I recently read an entire book of all its different variations as the story evolved over time in the hands of both Tolkien’s, father and son. By the way, maybe that’s the answer to your question. The very first dad to introduce his kids to Middle-earth was Tolkien himself — and once the love of that world is passed on, it stays for life.</br>Beren and Lúthien is not the only short story woven into The Silmarillion. Among all the cosmic world-building, there are check-ins with actual mortal characters — as you said, they are the ones who actually make the story compelling, especially since their stories so often end in tragedy. Túrin Turambar, for instance, is manipulated by an evil dragon into marrying his sister, with predictably Oedipal consequences.
        <span id="points6"></span><span id="moreText6">Then there are the constant croppings of new elf kingdoms, which for all their beauty and magic are eventually destroyed by the forces of Morgoth. This is the stuff you latch onto as a reader, and if The Silmarillion is ever made into a movie (preferably not with Peter Jackson, let’s get some new blood!) I think it would work best as a kind of anthology piece, with Morgoth’s war against the Elves forming the backdrop for all these more human stories.Beren and Lúthien’s story is the best because of its mixture of love, tragedy, and just bonkers fantasy adventure. Perhaps because Tolkien drew so much of it from his own marriage, the potent brew that is the Beren and Lúthien story is just so much more compelling than the parallel Aragorn/Arwen romance in The Lord of the Rings proper. That brings us to a major aspect of The Silmarillion . Many of its characters and stories (though far from all) are ancient antecedents to more familiar faces from The Lord of the Rings. Beren and Lúthien are Aragorn and Arwen’s ancestors, Morgoth is Sauron’s dark master, and the dark spirit Ungoliant is the progenitor of the monstrous spider Shelob.</p>

        <h1>Yes, let’s talk about Morgoth</h1>
        <h4>BY ARTHUR R. on FEBRUARY 8, 2019</h4>
        <p>While Sauron is essentially a servant of Morgoth who sets out to corrupt and conquer Middle-earth, Morgoth is the O.G., the creation of all evil that has ever existed in the world. Morgoth makes Sauron look like a low-level Disney villain. When Eru and the Valar were singing the world into existence, it was Morgoth who sowed discord and infused the earth with the very concept of evil. If Sauron is about dominion, control, and power, Morgoth exists purely to destroy. It doesn’t get much more hardcore than that. Which, in essence, is part of what makes The Silmarillion so fascinating. It wrestles with these big, heavy themes (like the root of all evil ever) in a way that is so engaging and gripping. Which I think is why, as you mention, we still haven’t seen a television or film adaptation. In some ways, The Silmarillion is unfilmable… It’d be a bit like trying to make a complete film adaptation of something like the Bible. How do you capture all of the stories and all of the complexities within a single filmed version?</p>
        <span id="points7"></span><span id="moreText7"><p>Personally, I’d love to see a film version of individual stories from the book, like Beren and Lúthien or Túrin Turambar. These are the tales that have a true narrative arc, which makes them easier to adapt. Alternatively, I have a dream that one day, someone will make an incredible anthology TV show with perfect production design that brings some of these stories to the screen. I think they’re beautiful and lively on the page, but imagine the cinematic possibilities of seeing Fingolfin storming Angband and singlehandedly dueling Morgoth, or Fëanor taking on a whole army of flaming balrogs, or Fingon rescuing his cousin Maedhros from the heights of Thangorodrim. This is the stuff my extremely nerdy dreams are made of.Do you think a Silmarillion adaptation is even possible? Even if it is, would people want to watch a film or show that is so grand in scope and so entrenched with these weighty questions of life, death, and purpose?</p>

        <h1>I certainly think an adaptation of The Silmarillion is doable</h1>
        <h4>BY ARTHUR R. on FEBRUARY 7, 2019</h4>
        <p>If you wanted to go the movie route, you could do it in the style of Robert Altman or those New York I Love You/Paris Je T’Aime anthologies, where you have these big ensemble casts and all these little stories nestled in this overreaching arc. But in this day and age, the best outlet for that kind of anthology storytelling is obviously television. Luckily, we have a contemporary example of a fantasy series that contemplates major socio-political questions alongside gigantic battles with fire-breathing dragons and has achieved enormous popularity. I actually think that The Silmarillion is the Tolkien work most similar to Game of Thrones (so much so that I included it on a list of books to read during the show’s hiatus). They seem to share an attitude towards evil. While Lord of the Rings stands as one of the most black-and-white conflicts in all of fiction, The Silmarillion has a more conflicted attitude. Yes, Morgoth is the font of it all, but does he really do the most evil in the book? What about Fëanor, whose pride and arrogance leads to so much devastation and death? Do the Valar themselves commit evil by abandoning elves and humans to the vagaries of Morgoth for centuries? </p>
        <span id="points8"></span><span id="moreText8"><p>He was one of the primordial spirits who shaped existence, so don’t we all carry a bit of Morgoth with us? Tolkien even writes that “it seems to the Elves that Men resemble Melkor most of all the Ainur, although he has ever feared and hated them, even those that served him.” In The Silmarillion, evil is everywhere — and that, more than anything, makes like a recipe for a prestige TV adaptation. The Silmarillion also depicts a lot of death, and most don’t get a Gandalf-style Get Out of Jail free card here. But the book’s attitude towards death is very interesting. It’s not sexy or exciting, as in Game of Thrones. Instead, death is painful and traumatic — and also, in some ways, a gift. Tolkien’s Elves live forever unless they are manually killed and are often plagued by sorrow and weariness as a result. But humans live only a short time, and that is Ilúvatar’s great gift to us. As Tolkien writes, “Therefore he willed that the hearts of Men should seek beyond the world and should find no rest therein; but they should have a virtue to shape their life, amid the power and chances of the world, and beyond the Music of the Ainur, which is as fate to all things else.” Contemplating the mysteries of life and death is one of the great pleasures of The Silmarillion, and that’s what will keep me coming back, even with all of its bumps and flaws, and regardless of whether it ever comes to the screen or not.</p>

        <h1>Aside from the Dwarvish runes</h1>
        <h4>BY ARTHUR R. on FEBRUARY 4, 2019</h4>
        <p>I got really into The Lord of the Rings in early elementary school, and it was the first long, “adult” book I remember finishing. I was hungry for more, so eventually, my dad (who first got me into Tolkien) gave me his copy of The Silmarillion, even though he had never really finished it himself. In a not-so-surprising twist, my young brain was turned off almost right away. An intricate, nigh-biblical telling of the origin of the cosmos was not quite the fantasy action I wanted. So I shelved it away for years.Then, a few years ago, I finally returned to The Silmarillion. It may have been inspired by The Hobbit movies, which I found mostly annoying except for the scenes with the White Council (Saruman, Gandalf, Galadriel, and Elrond). Their discussions and adventures, going on in the background of those movies, hinted at the greater Middle-earth mythology and reminded me how much I didn’t know. Also, there was a rather convincing fan theory going around at the time that the Arkenstone (those movies’ big MacGuffin) was a Silmaril. That interested me enough to check out The Silmarillion again, at which point I realized that this book is actually extremely my ish.</p>
        <span id="points9"></span><span id="moreText9"><p>One important thing to know about this book is how different it is from both of its famous siblings, The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. Unlike those, The Silmarillion is not an adventure story Tolkien wrote as a bedtime story for his kids or an epic fantasy he could read aloud to his university students. It’s meant to be a comprehensive atlas of this big mythology that was bubbling in Tolkien’s brain for his entire life, and it’s also unfortunately incomplete — it took Tolkien’s son Christopher decades after his father’s death to piece the manuscripts together in a comprehensible order (a lifelong process Christopher showcases in detail in his recent book-length treatment of Beren and Lúthien, if anyone out there is interested). But for all that, the imaginative scope of The Silmarillion is something to behold. Tolkien loved to build worlds, and early on he discusses his cosmic pantheon in depth. The Valar’s basic structure should be familiar to any student of mythology: Manwe the sky god is the leader, his wife Varda is queen of the stars, Ulmo controls the sea, Yavanna grows green, Aule builds things, Mandos is lord of the dead, Melkor is the fallen angel who turned against his kin, etc. But they each have rather unique personalities, and there are also some figures among them that indicate Tolkien’s deepest beliefs. My favorite Valar, for instance, is Nienna — basically the goddess of grief. As Tolkien writes, “she is acquainted in grief, and mourns for every wound that Arda (Earth) has suffered in the marring of Melkor.” But for Tolkien, coming to terms with the sadness of life is actually empowering: “all those who wait in Mandos cry to her, for she brings strength to the spirit and turns sorrow to wisdom.” Man, I love that.</p>
